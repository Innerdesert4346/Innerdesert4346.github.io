Rock Lee#7769 operates the TWRPG-BOT discord bot, which provides game info, user moderation, and other commands.

This page is used to inform TWRPG-BOT users regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of a user's message content if anyone decided to use our Service, the TWRPG-BOT discord bot.

If you choose to use TWRPG-BOT, then you agree to the collection and use of your message contents in relation with this policy. The message contents from a user that we collect are used for searching and providing requested data to the user (i.e. item info, boss info, user's avatar). 

In terms of moderation, we collect edited and deleted messages for admin use only, as an admin see's fit to use. Admins may opt-out of using this feature on their servers. We will not use or share your message contents with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Log Data
We want to inform you that whenever you use TWRPG-BOT, we log any message content that is used in combination with a command. This Log Data includes time and date, server name (or if it is in DM's), username, which command was used, and the content the command was used with. This log data is only used by Rock Lee#7769 for debugging purposes and is not shared with anyone. These Log Data's are stored on the bot's servers and are regularly purged.
